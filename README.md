## SafeRoads--AI Enabled Accident Detection

## Project Overview:
This repository contains the implementation of an AI system designed to enhance road safety through real-time vehicular collision detection. The Gardio web application demonstrates the entire accident detection process, providing a user-friendly interface. The YOLO algorithm is employed for robust collision detection.

## Tech Stack:
- Computer Vision: YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv8-cls
